🏡 USA Housing Price Prediction

This project is a simple end-to-end Data Science workflow focused on predicting house prices in the USA based on various features such as average area income, house age, number of rooms, and more.

📄 Project Overview

The notebook walks through the following steps:
	•	Data Loading & Exploration
Load the housing dataset and perform initial exploration to understand the data structure.
	•	Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handle missing values, drop unnecessary columns, check for duplicates, and prepare the data for modeling.
	•	Descriptive Analysis & Visualization
Gain insights from the dataset using descriptive statistics and visualize correlations between features.
	•	Model Building & Evaluation
Apply a Linear Regression model to predict house prices and evaluate its performance using metrics like:
	•	R² Score
	•	Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
	•	Mean Squared Error (MSE)

📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is USA_Housing.csv which contains information about housing features and their corresponding prices.

Features:
	•	Avg. Area Income
	•	Avg. Area House Age
	•	Avg. Area Number of Rooms
	•	Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms
	•	Area Population
	•	Price (Target Variable)
	•	Address

🚀 How to Run
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Housing_Prediction.git
cd Housing_Prediction

	2.	Install the required libraries:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

	3.	Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Housing_Prediction.ipynb

🧰 Libraries Used
	•	pandas
	•	numpy
	•	matplotlib
	•	seaborn
	•	scikit-learn

🔥 Results

The model was able to predict house prices with reasonable accuracy using Linear Regression. Further model improvements like feature engineering or advanced algorithms can be applied to boost performance.

📌 Future Improvements
	•	Hyperparameter tuning
	•	Try other regression models (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
	•	Deploy the model as an API or Web App
